If you want to use Ollama local OpenAI compitable API through a browser based tool, you need to allow CORS

**Check whether CORS is enabled**

```bash
curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:11434 -H "Origin: http://example.com" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" -I
```

Here we are checking if origin example.com is allowed 

If you get this output

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Date: Wed, 09 Oct 2024 10:12:15 GMT
Content-Length: 0
```

It means `CORS` is not enabled

**Enable CORS**

## On macOS

```
launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGINS "*"
```

or any origin you would like for example

```
launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGINS "example.com,voov.ai"
```

**Binding** 

Ollama listens on port 11434 only on localhost, if you would like it be accessible in network 

```
launchctl setenv OLLAMA_HOST "0.0.0.0"
```

You need to **restart** ollama after doing this


## On Windows

Go to System Properites -> Environment Variables. 

Add the variables `OLLAMA_HOST` and `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` depending on your requirements

## On Linux

Edit the `ollama.service` using the following command

```bash
sudo systemctl edit ollama.service
```

Add the following environment variables

```bash
[Service]
Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"
Environment="OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*"
```

Then restart the ollama service

```bash
sudo service ollama restart
```


## Testing

Your output should be like below if everything is setup right for Origins

```bash
(base) âžœ  ~ curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:11434 -H "Origin: http://example.com" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" -I
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization,Content-Type,User-Agent,Accept,X-Requested-With,X-Stainless-Lang,X-Stainless-Package-Version,X-Stainless-Os,X-Stainless-Arch,X-Stainless-Runtime,X-Stainless-Runtime-Version,X-Stainless-Async
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE,HEAD,OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Max-Age: 43200
Date: Wed, 09 Oct 2024 10:13:26 GMT
```

to make sure binding is correct, run the following command

```bash
(base) gavi@node1:~$ netstat -an |grep 11434
tcp6       0      0 :::11434                :::*                    LISTEN
```

As you can see the port is bound to all IPs on the machine
