Go to https://catalyst.voov.ai, Login with your favorite social authentication provider. Currently Catalyst supports Google, with others on the way.

## Default Model

Once you login to Catalyst, you will see an empty screen with a default model(VooV). This model can help you get familiar with Catalyst. It has similar capabilities as gpt-4o-mini without vision.

## Creating a new chat

Click on Add button to create a new chat. You will be presented with an input box where you could type your messgae and hit send. Wait for AI to respond, you should see streaming text and you could continue chatting. Everytime you chat, the previous conversation is sent back to AI, This is called as context.

If your context exceeds the size the model can hanlde it will be unable to process the request. It is highly recommended to create a new chat when you are discussing a different topic.
